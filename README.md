This project is maintained by Danara Smadiyarova and Ruzana Aishuakova from group CSSE-1702.

In our project we are working on creating a fictional restaraunt where clients have an opportunity to reserve a table and pre-submit their order.

We have 5 models with all possible DB relationships. They are:

User
Reservation
Category
Dish
Table

Maybe there will be more in the future? because the project is not finished.

Further relations between them:

One-To-Many between Category and Dish
One-To-One between User and Reservation (Table)
Many-To-Many between Reservation and Dish and etc.

We've created the template of the restaurant's menu and functions for login and registration.
We've implemented validation for the login and registration but on the theoretical level because we have troubles with DB connections and hoping that you can help us...

Will be looking for your respond!

With best regards, Danara and Ruzana.
